There is no web page for this course, but instead, a Unix
directory structure.  The proper way to access it is by using
ssh to log into a IC Solaris host (unix.ic.ucsc.edu).  However,
if you actually do like that silly pointy clicky method of
accessing information, the local web server will format the Unix
directories as web pages for you.

If you are looking in this directory properly, i.e., via Unix
commands, there is nothing of interest here.  Just ``cd ..''.
If you are a pointy clicky type, click on the colon above or
right here on this README to get to the course directory.  And
don't call it a folder.  The web link labelled Parent Directory
above is not actually the parent directory but a link to a
course web directory.

If you are using a web client on a ucsc.edu host, you should see
no password request.  From off campus, you need to enter a
username, but may leave the password field blank.  To discover
the username, log into unix.ic and look at the hidden file
``.htpasswd'' in the parent of this directory.
