<P>
This lab0-intro-unix will not be graded and there
is no credit for it.&nbsp;
However, it is important you understand the Unix command
line and submit procedure before you actually use it in the
first assignment.
<P>
Make sure you know how to submit files.&nbsp;
Submit these files to lab0.&nbsp;
Verify that the submit actually worked by looking
in the submit directory for your username.&nbsp;
The find(1) command is very useful for things like this.&nbsp;
<P>
The submit command copies your files into a directory
<BR>
<TT>/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/class/cmps109-wm.s15/lab0/$USER</TT>
<BR>
and prefixes each file with a sequence number.&nbsp;
You can see the names of the files, 
but not their contents.&nbsp;
<P>
Prior experience with Unix is assumed.&nbsp;
Attend a lab section to ask questions if you don't
understand how submit works.
The TA can explain such things.&nbsp;
<P>
Also read the submit checklist:&nbsp;

<P>
This directory shows a main program and a hello class and
illustrates various features of C++11 that will be covered
later in the course.&nbsp;
<P>
Whenever you need to look up information about C++,
use Google,
or look at
The C++ Resources Network:&nbsp;
