This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Ada Byron (abyron@@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Charles Babbage (cbabbage@@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Ada Byron spent       ____ hours working alone.
Charles Babbage spent ____ hours working alone.
We spent              ____ hours working together.
Ada Byron spent       ____ hours driving.
Charles Babbage spent ____ hours driving.

Please grade the work submitted by abyron@@ucsc.edu
and not the work submitted by cbabbage@@ucsc.edu.
