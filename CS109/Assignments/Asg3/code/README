Program - keyvalue


Description : This program keeps track of pairs of string
values like a dictionary. It can insert, delete, expose,
or overwrite values. Values are input from either standard
input or from a series of input files, or both.
key=value : key,value pair is inserted into the map, over-
writing any pair with that key that previously existed.
key= : deletes the key from the map.
=value : shows all pairs with the given value
= : show all pairs in the map
# : comment line, ignored.
