Assignment #2 - CS109 UCSC Spring 2015

ydc program

This program is a calculator that can work on very large numbers,
because it stores each number as a series of digits inside of a vector. 

The files included in this program are :

General utility files
util.h
util.cpp

Debugging utility files, not changed by myself.
debug.h
debug.cpp

The main code for the project, these files hold the class definition
and declaration for bigint. This class wraps around a vector of digits
that are used to represent arbitrarily large integers.
bigint.h
bigint.cpp

A trimmed down vector to hold our stack of big integers
iterstack.h

The scanner files handle scanning and parsing the input
scanner.h
scanner.cpp

Makefile - builds the project
