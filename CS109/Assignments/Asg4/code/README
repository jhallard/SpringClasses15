Program - gdraw


Description : This program supplies a simple drawing 
library for 2d shapes and text. It uses either user
supplied input files or input straight from stdin to
define and draw the objects. Once they are drawn, the
user can move them around and manipulate them using the
arrow keys.


NOTE - I sure hope it works when you run it. On my home
linux station everything works perfectly, but it would
refuse to open up the window when run on the unix time
share, although it would build just fine. I kept getting
a swrast library not found error, not sure what that 
means. 


NOTE 2 - Note, I had to change the following line in 
the makefile from 
mk-colors.perl > colors.cppgen
to
./mk-colors.perl > colors.cppgen

On my computer and the unix time share it wouldn't work
unless I specifed that mk-colors was local to the 
build directory. If it fails please try and change this
back to see if it works for you, or try to build from 
the directory containing the source files.
