retreival, and deletion of files. The following 
functionality is available :

put fn - put a file from the client to the server.
get fn - get a file from the server to the client
rm fn  - delete the given file from the server
ls     - list the files in the server's directory.

usage :

cixd [port] # this is the server program
cix [host] [port] # this is the client program
