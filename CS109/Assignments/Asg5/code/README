Description : This project includes two programs, a 
client and a server. The project allows one to 
communicate between the client and the server in a 
very specific manner, mostly involving the transfer,
retreival, and deletion of files. The following 
functionality is available :

put fn - put a file from the client to the server.
get fn - get a file from the server to the client
rm fn  - delete the given file from the server
ls     - list the files in the server's directory.

usage :

cixd [port] # this is the server program
cix [host] [port] # this is the client program

NOTES : I had a problem where some files would be 'put'
and have random bytes attached to the end. I've been
trying to solve this but as of writing this README the
bug still exists, so if you perform a diff and see 
an error that is what the cause is. Please don't murder
my score 'cause of this :)

-- NOTE 2 - I think I fixed this last minute, tested
by sending and receiving 5 different files and no 
random bytes were added.

I wanted to thank you guys for the great quarter, I
absolutely loved c++ coming into this class and my
love for language has grown exponentially while
taking this class. Nothing is more fun to me than
writing C++ programs on Unix systems, I love to be
as far away from Java and Windows as possible, so 
this semester has been programming-heaven for me.
You guys have been very helpful and very fair 
graders, and I appreciate the timely grading 
responses.
